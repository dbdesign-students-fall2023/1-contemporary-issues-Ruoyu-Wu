# Data sharing in academia
In this document, I discuss two articles about Cambridge Analytica's mining of Facebook data and the claims made by some that it altered the course of the 2016 US Presidential Election.  I present and discuss two opposing views on this important matter.\

## Article 1
In the article [The importance and challenges of data sharing](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41565-020-0646-0), benefits as well as obstacles regarding data sharing in academic practices are discussed. On one hand, it is important to increase the availability and transparency of data that have been used to draw conclusions in published papers. In fact, good quality databases already exist for fields like DNA sequencing,etc. On the other hand, meaningful and efficient data sharing actually requires a huge amount of effort. Work needs to be done to ensure that shared data are well organized, securely stored and clearly explained.\

I believe that in general, data sharing is a practice that should be encouraged in majority of the academic fields. Although the levels and components to make sharing sufficient can be very different from subjects to subjects and from fields to fields, higher level of sharing should be a direction to work towards.\

## Article 2
The article [Responsible, practical genomic data sharing that accelerates research](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41576-020-0257-5#Sec5), risks and ethical problems about data sharing, especially in the field of genomics are discussed. While in general, the sharing of data alone is an activity that poses little risk, problems might arise when data are longlasting and unique enough to reidentify the individuals from whom data were originally collected.\

Compared with the first article, this article is much more nuanced and also focus on a more niche field of academic data sharing, which is the genomics field. This is a rather tricky field where data sharing is relatively more highly related to privacy issues. This field provides us with a good example of a scenario where we should strictly prioritize privacy and ethical standards over benefits that might come from data sharing.\
